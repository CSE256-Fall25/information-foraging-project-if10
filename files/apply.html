      <!-- Application overview -->
        <p>
          An application fee of $40 is required when applying to the nursery
          school. After this is received, your child is placed on an enrollment
          list. You will be notified of acceptance in the March preceding the
          fall enrollment date. Upon acceptance, a nonrefundable deposit of one
          monthâ€™s tuition is due. This will be applied to tuition for the
          following May.

          <p>
            This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the child and parent(s) an
            opportunity to visit the classroom and meet the teachers and classmates. This visit is one
            hour. It will allow time for the child to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) a brief
            overview of what to expect during the school year.
          </p>
          <p>
          The next day, children begin attending school on their own. Half of the class attends on
          Wednesday and the other half attends on Thursday. This schedule allows the children and
          teachers to interact with a smaller group before the entire class comes together on Friday.
